# Changelog

All notable changes to SmartupCMS will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and releases use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Explicit primitive colour scales (`--color-<hue>-<step>`) behind the existing
  semantic design tokens, so a neighbouring step is available where one is
  needed for contrast.
- `npm run contrast:audit` gate, enforced in CI. It discovers every rule that
  sets both a background and a text colour, resolves both through the design
  tokens in each theme, and fails below the WCAG AA minimum.
- CI enforcement of the localization contract: the audit documented in the
  contribution guide now runs on every change, and the generated Russian
  fallback dictionary is regenerated and compared, so it can no longer drift
  from the canonical catalog unnoticed.
- Theme changes propagate to the application's other open tabs over a
  same-origin broadcast channel, so a window left open no longer keeps the
  previous theme until it is reloaded.
- Local, audited announcement authoring and lifecycle management.
- Read-only system status API and administration screen.
- S3-compatible object storage for AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, MinIO, and compatible
  providers.
- Encrypted database backup sidecar with sanitized local status reporting.
- Apache-2.0 community, governance, security, and contribution policies.

### Changed

- Unified the product as one SmartupCMS installation for one organization and
  many users.
- Renamed runtime applications to `server` and `web` and consolidated the
  production Compose topology.
- Made all standard runtime behavior local and disabled outbound telemetry by
  default.

### Fixed

- Dark-theme text on solid accent fills no longer uses a hard-coded white.
  Primary buttons, active pagination and sidebar items, avatars, and tabs now
  read the per-theme `--on-primary` ink, raising the worst measured contrast
  from 2.14:1 to 9.07:1. Destructive buttons (3.76:1) and danger badges and
  alerts (4.29:1) were below WCAG AA in dark theme and now pass at 5.16:1 and
  5.84:1.
- The application fetched Inter and Material Symbols from a third-party CDN,
  so in a closed network every icon rendered as its own name in text and the
  interface was visibly broken, while each page load disclosed the viewer's
  address to that third party. Both fonts now ship with the build and are
  served from the application's own origin.
- Status colours across features painted fixed hues that ignored the theme:
  success, warning, danger and info were written as literals, and 83 `var()`
  fallbacks masked their own tokens. Colour properties now read the semantic
  tokens, leaving only data, the note card palette and category hues literal.
- The collapsed sidebar's flyout panel ignored the theme: it painted the
  light-theme sidebar colour in both, so in dark theme it did not match the
  sidebar it belongs to. Its active entry also failed WCAG AA at 4.10:1 in
  both themes, and now passes at 5.67:1. The sidebar chrome reads a named set
  of tokens for its permanently dark surface instead of 27 literals.
- Invisible and unreadable text in dark theme caused by colour properties
  pointing at design tokens that were never defined, so their `var()` fallback
  painted the same light-theme colour in both themes. Notes measured 1.04:1,
  and twelve invented token names across nine files now point at the tokens
  they were synonyms for.
- Every remaining colour pair below WCAG AA, found by the new audit: danger and
  info text on their subtle backgrounds (4.29:1 and 4.00:1) now use dedicated
  `--danger-text` and `--info-text` inks; the dark tertiary text tier
  (3.17:1-3.61:1) moved one scale step lighter; and hard-coded light-theme
  literals in the sidebar count badge, the navigation row hover, and the
  embedded report error and fallback bars now read theme tokens, so those
  surfaces are no longer light-on-light in dark theme.

### Removed

- Control Plane, fleet management, heartbeat, enrollment, and license gates.
